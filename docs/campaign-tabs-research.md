# Mission Select / campaign tabs — how it works (SOLVED 2026-05-28)

The 2026-05-21 "research-only" version of this doc had four unresolved unknowns. They're now **resolved** by live testing on the Steam Deck (swapping a repacked base `CONFIG.MEG` and reading the result via screenshots). MEG extraction *and* repacking are solved; the Mission Select display pipeline is mapped.

Tools: `scripts/meg_extract.py` (read), **`scripts/meg_pack.py`** (repack — byte-identical round-trip, no integrity check), `scripts/mix_namedb.py` (CRC→name). Format detail: `mix-file-format.md`. Launcher boundary: `launcher-vs-dll-ownership.md`.

## TL;DR — the corrected model

**The Mission Select display is built from `DATA/XML/INSTANCES.XML`, not the campaign-structure files.** Each mission is an `<Instance>` carrying:

- `<LocationNameTextID>` (name) + `<MissionBriefingTextID>` (briefing) → localized strings
- **`<ShowOnMissionSelect>`** — visibility gate; `false` **hides the mission even if you've completed it** (proven)
- **`<IsUnlockedAtStart>`** — `true` ⇒ always shown; otherwise gated by player progress
- `<House>`, `<Mission>N</Mission>`, **`<ExternalGameID>`** (`RedAlert` | `TiberianDawn`), brief/action/win movies, `MissionSelectMapTexture`

The **structure files** — `RA_ALLIES.XML` (progression), `RA_ALLIES_MISSIONS.XML` (mission defs + `MapStageUnlock` chain), `RA_CAMPAIGNMAPS.XML`/`CAMPAIGNMAPS.XML` (`CampaignMapSelectMapClass` per tab + the territory-map-select flow) — control **progression and launch, NOT the displayed roster.** Editing them changes what *launches*, not what *shows*.

`CONFIG.MEG` has **no integrity check**, so a repacked archive with edited XML loads fine, and the game *does* read it (proven: breaking a mission def killed that mission's launch).

## What controls what (each row proven on the Deck)

| To change… | Edit | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Whether a mission **shows** | `INSTANCES.XML` `ShowOnMissionSelect` | set Allied 5A/5B/5C `false` → "Tanya's Tale" vanished despite being completed |
| Mission **name / briefing** | `INSTANCES.XML` `LocationNameTextID` / `MissionBriefingTextID` | data-confirmed (TextIDs → localized strings) |
| **Always visible** vs progress-gated | `IsUnlockedAtStart` | expansion missions are `true` → always show (never hide) |
| Whether a mission **launches** | `RA_*_MISSIONS.XML` def + `MapStageUnlock` | removed `RA_ALLIES_14` def → its "Start" did nothing; mission 1 still launched |
| Which **game's front-end** lists it | `ExternalGameID` | GDI instances are `TiberianDawn` ⇒ don't appear in RA mode |
| **Add / place** a mission in a tab | new `<Instance>` (target name + `Variant`, `ShowOnMissionSelect=true`, `IsUnlockedAtStart=true`) | ✅ injected `Mobius_Allied_Campaign_99_Map` → "Allies 99" appeared in the Allied tab (no def/`<Stages>` needed; name needs an RA-mode TextID; *launch* untested) |

### The experiments (base-CONFIG.MEG swap)
- Truncate all three structure files to 2 missions → **display still showed 14**; mission 14 un-launchable. ⇒ structure = launch, not display.
- Append expansion missions to `RA_ALLIES` `<Stages>` → **did not appear** under Allied. ⇒ roster isn't built from `<Stages>`.
- `ShowOnMissionSelect=false` on 3 completed Allied missions → **vanished**. ⇒ `INSTANCES.XML` is the display source, flag overrides progress.
- Ant tab shows **2 of 4** though all 4 are `ShowOnMissionSelect=true` ⇒ display is **progress-gated** (only unlocked missions show). A per-player completion/unlock record exists — *not* in `Player_RA_settings_1.bin` (no campaign strings); likely Steam cloud/stats.
- Inject a brand-new instance (`Mobius_Allied_Campaign_99_Map`, Allied variant, `ShowOnMissionSelect=true`, `IsUnlockedAtStart=true`, a deliberately-foreign GDI name TextID) → **a new "Allies 99" row appeared** in the Allied tab (name fell back to a placeholder because the TD TextID doesn't resolve in RA). ⇒ **placement is data-controllable.** So the "move" you want = **add-under-target-tab + hide-original** — both halves now proven. Caveats: name needs an RA-mode string; the *bare* instance displays but its launch isn't wired (no real scenario).

## CONFIG.MEG campaign files (catalogue)

```
DATA/XML/INSTANCES.XML            ~395 KB — MASTER INSTANCE DEFS = the display source
DATA/XML/CAMPAIGNS.XML            empty wrapper (real lists are the two manifests below)
DATA/XML/PROGRESSIVECAMPAIGNFILES.XML / PROGRESSIVECAMPAIGNMISSIONFILES.XML  — file manifests
DATA/XML/CAMPAIGNS/RA_ALLIES.XML  + RA_ALLIES_MISSIONS.XML    progression + defs
DATA/XML/CAMPAIGNS/RA_USSR.XML    + RA_USSR_MISSIONS.XML
DATA/XML/CAMPAIGNS/RA_AFTERMATH.XML + RA_AFTERMATH_MISSIONS.XML  (Counterstrike + Aftermath)
DATA/XML/CAMPAIGNS/GDI.XML  NOD.XML  CONSOLE.XML  FUNPARK.XML  ANT.XML  (+ *_MISSIONS.XML)
DATA/XML/CAMPAIGNS/CAMPAIGNMAPS.XML + RA_CAMPAIGNMAPS.XML   CampaignMapSelectMapClass per tab (GuiLayer)
DATA/ART/GUI/.../*_CAMPAIGN_SELECT.BUI, UI_MISSIONSELECT.BUI  UI layout (Unity binary; not edited)
```
Instances cluster by `Variant` (campaign base): 22 `Mobius_Allied_Campaign_Base`, 20 USSR, 8 Allied-Counterstrike, 9 Aftermath-Allied, etc. `Variant` is the **map base** (House, Faction, music), not a clean tab tag. Tabs themselves = `CampaignMapSelectMapClass` `GuiLayer` (`RA_ALLIES`, `RA_USSR`, `TD_GDI`, …).

## The engine wall (unchanged, and decisive)

GDI/Nod **campaign missions are `ExternalGameID=TiberianDawn`** — TD-game instances on a TD-mode tab (`GuiLayer="TD_GDI"`). They will **not** appear in our RA mod's Mission Select. A *playable* GDI/Nod campaign in the RA mod needs **new RA-mode instances**, because the TD scenario format won't run in the RA engine.

## Path to add GDI/Nod campaign sections

1. **Author RA-format scenario maps** for the GDI/Nod missions — the real content work.
2. Add `<Instance>` entries to `INSTANCES.XML`: `ExternalGameID=RedAlert`, `House=GDI`/`Nod` (HOUSE_GOOD/HOUSE_BAD), name/briefing TextIDs, `ShowOnMissionSelect=true`, `IsUnlockedAtStart=true` (or a `MapStageUnlock` chain).
3. Host them in a tab (`CampaignMapSelectMapClass`) — likely a repurposed RA tab; whether an RA-mode mission can ride a TD `GuiLayer` tab is **untested**.
4. Repack `CONFIG.MEG` with `meg_pack.py`.

## Two open issues

1. **Distribution.** Editing the lists means shipping a modified **base** `CONFIG.MEG` (44 MB). Editing the install file directly is reverted by Steam "verify" and isn't Workshop-clean. Whether a mod's `Data/CONFIG.MEG` overlay **shadows** the base (distributable) or is ignored is **untested** — the loose-XML overlay did *not* work for front-end campaign data (the front-end reads base CONFIG.MEG), so whole-MEG shadow is the open question.
2. **The RA roster-build wrinkle (native code).** Editing the RA Allied tab's `<Stages>` never moved the displayed roster — only `ShowOnMissionSelect` did. So the exact RA left-panel roster build lives in `ClientG.exe`. Irrelevant for *adding* new instances; relevant only for cleanly *relocating* existing missions between RA tabs (would need more experiments or a targeted Ghidra dive).
