# Co-op missions — design & feasibility

**Status:** Research complete (2026-05-29). No code written yet. This doc is the canonical
design record for the GDI/Nod co-op campaign arc. Supersedes the scattered notes in
`project-coop-missions-feasibility` memory (which now points here).

**Goal (Luke, 2026-05-29):** *scripted* co-op missions — e.g. Player 1 = GDI, Player 2 =
Allies, CPU = Soviets — with a pre-placed enemy base, triggered attack waves, a briefing,
and real objectives. NOT just "skirmish with a friend" (that already works; see Tier 1 below).

---

## 1. Two tiers — and why only Tier 2 is a feature

The engine already supports multiple factions + team alliances in one multiplayer game, so
two distinct experiences fall out:

### Tier 1 — Co-op skirmish (works today, zero code)
Two humans on the same lobby team vs an AI on a different team, on any custom MP map. Win =
last team standing (`MPlayer_Defeated`). **No DLL change, no scripting.** This is literally a
team skirmish — not worth special engineering. Caveat: factions are *lobby-picked*, not
map-forced (see §3).

### Tier 2 — Co-op scripted mission (the actual feature)
Same human/AI setup, but the `.mpr` carries a pre-placed enemy base, scripted attack teams
(Teamtypes + Triggers), a mission briefing, and **scripted objective** win/lose
(`TACTION_WIN` / `TACTION_LOSE` — "destroy the Soviet HQ", "survive 20 min", "your ally's
base must hold"). This is the "play a campaign mission with a friend" experience and is the
**only part that needs engine work** — because the scripted win/lose and briefing paths are
gated to single-player. Removing those gates (for co-op maps only) is "Path B".

---

## 2. How factions map to houses (the mechanism that makes 4-faction games possible)

Our mod relabels two orphaned RA country slots in the closed launcher's picker:

- **Picking "Spain" → `HOUSE_GOOD` (GDI)** — `dllinterface.cpp:914`
- **Picking "Turkey" → `HOUSE_BAD` (Nod)** — `dllinterface.cpp:917`

(Spain is fully orphaned in vanilla; Turkey's only baggage was a hidden +10% build-speed
bonus gated on `ActLike==HOUSE_TURKEY`, which no longer matches after the swap. France stays
vanilla — Phase Tank.)

Then in `GlyphX_Assign_Houses` (`dllinterface.cpp:1159`), **every MP player — human or AI —
gets a real house slot `HOUSE_MULTI1 + i`**, and their picked faction is written as that
house's **`ActLike`** via `Init_Data` (line 1278). `ActLike` is the faction-identity lever:
it gates the buildable tech tree (`Owner=` lists), unit voices, radar SFX, classic-palette
remap — everything faction-specific keys off it. Alliances come from lobby **team IDs** —
same team → `Make_Ally` (line 1341).

**Consequence:** GDI (`ActLike=HOUSE_GOOD`), Allied (`ActLike=HOUSE_GREECE`/`ENGLAND`/…), and
Soviet (`ActLike=HOUSE_USSR`) are just three different `ActLike` values on three Multi houses.
The engine already runs all four factions together — proven by the GDI/Nod skirmish-AI work
(`project-gdi-nod-skirmish-ai-baseline`). A co-op mission is therefore not a new house system;
it's scripting + a small win/lose-in-MP patch on top of the existing faction plumbing.

## 3. Map discovery (RESOLVED — disk + editor-source evidence)

**Discovery directory (confirmed on the Deck):**
`Documents/CnCRemastered/Local_Custom_Maps/Red_Alert/` — holds 73 real `.mpr` maps.

Each map = a **triplet**:
- `<name>.mpr` — the full scenario INI (briefing, triggers, teams, houses, win/lose)
- `<name>.tga` — preview thumbnail
- `<name>.json` — launcher discovery manifest: `{MapTileX/Y/Width/Height, Theater, Waypoints[]}`

Two naming families coexist: local-authored short names (`RDS06.mpr`) and Workshop-synced
(`UGC_<itemid>_<hash>_MAPDATA.MPR`; RA's meta suffix is `MAPDATA`, per editor source
`GameInfoRedAlert.cs:364`). `Custom_Maps/` + `Custom_Map_Previews/` also exist (Workshop
cache). The dev-machine prefix has the dirs but they're empty (game never ran there).

**The `.json` has no "co-op"/category field** — the lobby list is built from geometry +
`Waypoints[]` (= start positions / max players; RDS01=8, a sample UGC map=4). So co-op-ness is
NOT discovery metadata; it lives in the `.mpr` content + our gate-patch.

**DLL entry point:** `CNC_Start_Custom_Instance` (`dllinterface.cpp:1642`) receives
`directory_path` + `scenario_name` from the launcher, does `snprintf("%s%s.mpr", …)`, loads
via `CCFileClass`, and **already parses the file as an INI** (`ini.Load`, reads `[Basic]
Name` + `[Digest]`). The directory choice is launcher-owned (closed `ClientG.exe`), but the
on-disk evidence pins it to `Local_Custom_Maps/Red_Alert/`.

**Distribution verdict:** co-op missions ship as a **map pack** (triplet drop into
`Local_Custom_Maps/Red_Alert/`, or Workshop-published from the editor) shipped *alongside*
the DLL mod — NOT inside the mod's `Data/`. The DLL supplies the gate-patch; the maps ride
separately.

**Faction-forcing caveat:** factions are lobby-picked, not map-forced. The `.mpr` sets
positions, alliances, and the scripted enemy house, but it can't cleanly force a human to be
GDI vs Allied — the GlyphX house-assignment overrides `House` from the picker. So "P1=GDI,
P2=Allies" is a lobby convention (players pick those slots), and the scripted Soviet enemy is
authored into the map. The safe enemy implementation is a **Multi-slot AI house** with
`ActLike=HOUSE_USSR` (triggers target `HOUSE_MULTI3` etc.) rather than a pre-placed non-Multi
`HOUSE_USSR`/"BadGuy" house — whether a non-Multi scenario house activates in MP is the one
open empirical question (§6).

## 4. Authoring — Mobius Map Editor

`reference/MobiusMapEditor` (cloned 2026-05-29, gitignored). It is Nyerguds' actively-
maintained fork of EA's open-source `CnCTDRAMapEditor` — same EA-source→improved-fork lineage
as our DLL↔Vanilla-Conquer. (We also have EA stock in the game install `SOURCECODE/` and two
local checkouts: `~/Documents/development/CnC_Remastered_Collection` (EA) and `.../EMC_Workshop`
(JohnnyJigglez EMC fork).)

Relevant capabilities (from its source + MANUAL):
- SP/MP toggle = **`BasicSection.SoloMission`** → `[Basic] SoloMission=`. Validation:
  `!SoloMission && numWaypoints<2` → error (MP needs ≥2 starts); `SoloMission && no Home
  waypoint` → error.
- **Co-op map shape = `SoloMission=false`** (surfaces in LAN lobby, 2+ human starts) **+
  hand-authored Teamtypes/Triggers** (the editor writes triggers into *any* map).
- The MANUAL caveat — *"scripting is mostly a singleplayer thing, severely limited in
  multiplayer"* — describes the **engine's** MP win/lose gates (exactly the 4 we patch), NOT
  an editor limitation on writing the triggers.
- Editor auto-writes the `.json`+`.tga` meta files for MP maps (unless ClassicFiles mode,
  `ClassicProducesNoMetaFiles`). Built-in Steam Workshop publish (`SteamworksUGC.cs`), needs
  the Remaster installed. WinForms .NET — runs via Proton/Wine, or v1.5.0.0+ "Classic mode"
  without the Remaster.

---

## 5. Path B — the win/lose-in-MP patch (the 4 gates)

All four gates confirmed in **current** source (2026-05-29):

**Win/lose (the essential pair) — `house.cpp`:**
- `house.cpp:1213` — `if (Session.Type == GAME_NORMAL && IsToWin && BorrowedTime == 0 && Blockage <= 0)` → sets `PlayerWins`/`PlayerLoses`
- `house.cpp:1225` — `if (Session.Type == GAME_NORMAL && IsToLose && BorrowedTime == 0)` → sets `PlayerLoses`/`PlayerWins`

**Briefing (nice-to-have) — `scenario.cpp`:**
- `scenario.cpp:316` — `if (Session.Type != GAME_NORMAL) briefing = false;`
- `scenario.cpp:386` — `if (Session.Type == GAME_NORMAL && Scen.BriefMovie == VQ_NONE) Display_Briefing_Text_GlyphX();`
- `scenario.cpp:394` — text/movie availability fallback, same SP gate

**Key observation:** each gate is **already self-gating on map content.** Win/lose only fire
if the map carries `TACTION_WIN`/`LOSE` triggers (`IsToWin` stays false otherwise); the
briefing text only shows if the map has briefing text. So relaxing them is *fairly* safe even
unconditionally — but "fairly" is why we want a discriminator (§7).

The backstop is preserved either way: `IsDefeated` / `MPlayer_Defeated` (`house.cpp:4232`,
called at 1241) remains the last-team-standing safety net if a mission's scripted win never
fires.

## 6. Discriminator decision — how the engine tells "co-op mission" from "skirmish"

All three options below share one fact: `CNC_Start_Custom_Instance` already has the `.mpr`
open as an INI, so reading a map flag is free, and it's the single entry point co-op maps come
through.

### Option 1 — Map flag in the `.mpr` *(RECOMMENDED)*
Read e.g. `ini.Get_Bool("Basic", "CoopMission", false)` in `CNC_Start_Custom_Instance`; store
on **`Scen.IsCoopMission`** (new `ScenarioClass` field — `Scen` is wiped by `Clear_Scenario`
each load, so no state leak into the next skirmish). Gates become
`(Session.Type == GAME_NORMAL || Scen.IsCoopMission)`.
- **Pros:** opt-in → **zero blast radius** (flag absent = byte-identical to today for every
  existing map, ours and Workshop's); data-driven (co-op-ness travels with the map); self-
  contained in the DLL; migration-friendly (can be promoted to drive Option 3 later).
- **Cons:** Mobius has no "co-op" checkbox → the key is added by hand / post-process (one
  `[Basic]` line). Must verify the `Clear_Scenario` reset path actually runs between an MP
  game and the next.
- **Cost:** ~6 lines (4 gates + read + field).

### Option 2 — Relax the gates for all MP
Flip the 4 gates to `(== GAME_NORMAL || == GAME_GLYPHX_MULTIPLAYER)`. No flag, no new state.
- **Pros:** simplest; no per-map authoring step.
- **Cons:** changes behavior for **every** MP game, including the hundreds of Workshop maps we
  don't own. Self-gating on map content makes it low-probability, but a competitive map with a
  stray win trigger or leftover briefing text would silently change behavior → an
  unreproducible bug report. "Probably fine," not "fine by construction."
- **Cost:** ~6 lines, but uncontrolled surface.

### Option 3 — New `GAME_GLYPHX_COOP` Session.Type
Add a session-type value; set it ourselves in `CNC_Start_Custom_Instance` **based on a map
flag** (so it *contains* Option 1). Then audit every `Session.Type` check — ~20 in `house.cpp`
alone, dozens across `scenario.cpp`/`display.cpp`/`sidebar.cpp`/scoring — to decide whether
COOP matches the MP (networking) or NORMAL (scripting) branch.
- **Pros:** semantically cleanest; obvious home for future co-op-specific behavior.
- **Cons:** by far most invasive; **missing one check = a subtle mode-specific bug**
  (networking doesn't engage, score screen miscounts, …); still needs the map flag anyway;
  harder to revert.
- **Cost:** many sites, audit-driven.

### Verdict

| Option | Risk to existing maps | Lines | Authoring cost | Future-proof |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1 — map flag** | none (opt-in) | ~6 | 1 INI key/map | promotes to #3 |
| **2 — relax gates** | low but uncontrolled | ~6 | none | dead-end |
| **3 — new type** | high (audit-driven) | many | 1 INI key/map | n/a (is the ceiling) |

**Option 1** — same line-count as the "simple" option but risk-free by construction,
data-driven, and a clean stepping stone to Option 3 if co-op ever outgrows these 4 gates.

## 7. Open items (next phase, when code work starts)

1. **Coordination:** the briefing gates are in `scenario.cpp`, which the TDE4-port instance is
   currently editing (a reveal-all DEV TOGGLE is flipped ON in the uncommitted tree). The
   **win/lose gates (`house.cpp`) don't collide** — start there. Do the `scenario.cpp`
   briefing gates after TDE4 lands, or in a worktree.
2. **Empirical: scripted enemy house in MP.** Confirm whether a pre-placed non-Multi house
   (`HOUSE_USSR`/"BadGuy") activates in an MP session, or whether the Soviet enemy must be a
   Multi-slot AI house (`HOUSE_MULTI3`, triggers target it). Multi-slot is the safe bet.
3. **Empirical: LAN smoke test.** Author a minimal `SoloMission=false` map with one scripted
   win trigger (e.g. timed or destroy-target), apply the chosen discriminator + win/lose
   patch, host a 2-human LAN game on the Deck, confirm the scripted win fires (vs falling back
   to last-team-standing). Two humans needed — Luke + a second account/Deck.
4. **First milestone proposal:** Option-1 flag + the two `house.cpp` win/lose gates + a trivial
   test `.mpr` → smoke test. Defer briefing gates + real mission design until that proves out.
5. **TD story NPCs available for mission scripting.** TD's `InfantryType` enum includes three
   scripted story characters — **Dr. Moebius** (`INFANTRY_MOEBIUS`), **Agent "Delphi"**
   (`INFANTRY_DELPHI`), **Dr. Chan** (`INFANTRY_CHAN`) — deliberately out of scope for the
   buildable faction roster (not faction-buildable, no sidebar entry), but they're ready-made
   **escort / rescue / capture / VIP mission objectives** if a GDI/Nod campaign is authored.
   They'd port like any TD infantry (sprite bundle via `bundle_unit.py` + an `idata.cpp` ctor)
   but be **placed via the Mobius editor (§4), not built**. TD assets exist in the MEG; not yet
   ported. Their voices/cameos would only matter if a mission surfaces them in the UI.
